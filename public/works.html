			<h2>How this site works</h2>
			<br>
			<p>SRS stands for "Simple Rating System". It is a mathematical formula that produces a single number to represent the strength of a team. This number can be compared directly against an opponent's SRS rating to predict who will win and by how many points. I did not invent the formula, it's been around for decades. It's also far from the only formula that produces a points predictor (but its simplicity is nice for those without a particularly strong math background, like myself). For more information about the formula itself, <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2015/03/srs-calculation-details/">visit sports-reference.com</a> (where I first discovered the SRS).</p>
			<p>The ability to predict the number of points a team should win or lose a game by has obvious sportsbetting implications. If the SRS has a team as a significantly larger favorite or underdog than the spread, there is an opportunity to use the SRS prediction to make a good bet. The larger the gap between the SRS prediction and the spread, the stronger the probability that the SRS prediction will beat the spread.</p>
			<p>I've done research using all games from 2011-2015 as a dataset that validates the accuracy of the SRS. To do this, I obtained the game scores for each game, the spread for each game, and calculated the SRS rating for each team in each of their games. I then tracked the win percentage of the SRS when used to bet against the spread. If the bettor limited bets to only those games where the gap between the SRS prediction and the spread was at least 2.5 points (I call this the "edge"), the SRS prediction beat the spread over 60% of the time. This is a critical finding because it is well over the win percentage required to beat the juice. A bettor need only win 53% of the time, making the SRS clearly profitable against the juice.</p>
			<p>After doing the research, I put the system to the test over the past three years. In addition to limiting my bets to games that had an SRS prediction strength of at least 2.5 points, I was also able to do something that was not accounted for in my research: I was able to take individual game conditions into account, like injuries or players resting on Week 17. Over the past three years, betting the SRS has yielded a 61% win rate for me.</p>
			<p>This site is very simple. The Games page displays a table containing all of the current week's games, along with the spread and the SRS for both teams. The Bet? column lists the team that the SRS suggests betting against the spread. Note that homefield advantage has been weighed at 2.5 points. If the SRS does not have at least a 2.5 point edge on the spread, the suggested bet is "none".</p>
			<p>I claim no credit for inventing a method for using the SRS against the spread. Though I don't personally know anyone who used it for this purpose before I did, I have no doubt that they are out there in great numbers. Moreover, there are people out there using far more sophisticated statistical models for this purpose and if you're really serious about beating the house for big money, you should invest your attention in researching those models. If you just like to bet nickels and dimes like I do, the SRS is a great resource for getting the upper hand on the house. But Caveat Emptor (and good luck!)</p>
